These folders contain all keys for 1024 bit DSA and 2048 bit RSA encryption that Debian was generating incorrectly for a brief period in 2008.
Due to a problem with entropy in their algorithm, they were only generating 65,635 unique keys. When correctly impemented, there should be 3.2 * 10^616 keys.   
So instead of spending 6.4 quadrillion years trying to crack a legitimate RSA key, we can just authenticate with each of these 65,365 keys and succeed before too long.

The actual keys are not uploaded here due to space
