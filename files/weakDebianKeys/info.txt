This is a list of all 1024 bit DSA and 2048 bit RSA keys that Debian was generating incorrectly.
Due to a problem with entryopy in their algorithm, they were only generating 65,635 unique keys. When correctly impemented, there should be 3.2 * 10^616 keys.   
Instead of spending 6.4 quadrillion years trying to crack a legitimate RSA key, we can just test each of the 65,635 keys that they used. 

The actual keys are not uploaded due to space
They are pulled from this repo: https://github.com/g0tmi1k/debian-ssh
